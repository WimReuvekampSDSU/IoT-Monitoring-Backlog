The effort points and rationale of the 1-8 point range.

- '1' effort is minimal, and not going to take long
- '8' effort is max, in that it will likely take the whole sprint
The thought process behind our priority rankings:

- '1' is a high priority; necessary to continue the project
- '5' is a medium priority; not immediately necessary but useful
- '10' is low priority; can be suspended or optional as the project progresses
